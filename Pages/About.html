        <h2>Ethos</h2>
        <p>
          Empathy is at the core of what I do. <br>
          I'm a flexible and open minded person, who thrives on variety and challenge. <bR>
          Every client and project is individual and unique, so I try to take a holistic approach within my work. <br>
          I design with accessibility in mind as I believe that prioritising visibility and usability for the minority
          enhances usability for the majority and ultimately leads to an overall more effective and inclusive final
          product. <br>
          Left-field and playful
        </p>

        <h2>AI Statement</h2>
        <p>
          At my core, I strive to respect people and the planet - minimising harm and contributing to positive change
          where possible. In my opinion, GenAI fundamentally goes against these principles. Therefore, at this time, and
          in its current form, I cannot in good conscience use generative AI within my work.<br>
          GenAI openly plagiarises and regurgitates the work of human creatives en masse, without our consent or offer
          of financial compensation.
          <br> GenAI has the capacity to perpetuate harmful biases against already marginalised groups of people.
          <br>GenAI has ever-increasing water requirements - the repurcussions of which are already being felt by those
          of less privileged socio-economic groups.
          <br>GenAI directly contributes to global warming - which will affect all of us in increasingly devastating
          ways, regardless of wealth or status.
          <br>GenAI is not a designer.
          <br>I believe that good design is rooted in the process of empathising with the needs of the client, and
          drawing upon unique solutions firmly rooted in knowledge and experience of core design principles and human
          nature. GenAI does not - and may never - have the capacity to replicate this process.
          All I can offer is 100% homegrown, organic, human creativity.
