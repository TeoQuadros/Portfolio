          <br>While development work isn't my particular passion, I bring a competent understanding of common frontend principles & workflows (Github, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap/Tailwind) to my design projects. I can jump into VS Code to tweak styling or iterate straight-to-code if needed.

          <br>This means I understand the impact of my design choices on complexity/time-intensity/energy efficiency of implementing them, for a smoother, happier handover.

      <h2>AI Statement</h2>
      
      <button class="accordion"><p class="large-text">I do not use any kind of AI within my workflow. Find out why</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="large-text">
        <b>At my core, I strive to respect people and the planet - minimising harm and contributing to positive change
        where possible.</b></p>
      <p>In my opinion, GenAI fundamentally goes against these principles. Therefore, at this time, and
        in its current form, I cannot in good conscience use generative AI within my work.<br>
      <p>GenAI <b>openly plagiarises</b> and regurgitates the work of human creatives en masse, without our consent or
        offer
        of financial compensation.</p>
      <p>GenAI has the capacity to <b>perpetuate harmful biases</b> against already marginalised groups of people.
      </p>
      <p>GenAI has <b>ever-increasing water requirements</b> - the repurcussions of which are already being felt by
        those
        of less privileged socio-economic groups.</p>

      <p>GenAI <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117"><b>demands huge
            amounts of energy</b></a>, directly contributing to global warming - which will affect all of us in
        increasingly devastating
        ways, regardless of wealth or status.</p>
      <p><b>GenAI is not a designer.</b>
        <br>I believe that good design is rooted in the process of empathising with the needs of the client, and
        drawing upon unique solutions firmly rooted in knowledge and experience of core design principles and research.
        GenAI does not - and may never - have the capacity to replicate this process.
      <p> <em>All I can offer is 100% homegrown, organic, human creativity <3</em>
