        <h2>The Human</h2>

        <h3>I’m an open minded, offbeat person. I delight in the weird and wonderful of the everyday. I’m an enjoyer of
          street art and pigeons, drinker of large cappuccinos and aficionado of Grotesque fonts. I love swimming in
          cold lakes, eating warm croissants and late-night charcoal sketching sessions. I’m a big fan of those people
          who hook mushrooms up to electrodes and produce ambient-electronic mushroom music.</h3>

        <h2>The Creative</h2>

        <h3>I have been painting and drawing since I was capable of holding a paintbrush. My lifelong love of art has
          led me to design, as I feel like it’s a really tangible way to bring more visual interest into the everyday. I
          take great joy in solving design challenges, and I’m fascinated by the intersection of core design principles
          and technology.</h3>

      <h2>What inspires me?
      </h2>
      <h3>Human nature. Brutalism. Minimalism.
        <br>Conscious indulgence. Underconsumption as an act of rebellion.
        <br>Design as a means to spread joy.
      </h3>

      <h2>AI Statement</h2>
      <h4>
        At my core, I strive to respect people and the planet - minimising harm and contributing to positive change
        where possible.</h4>
      <p>In my opinion, GenAI fundamentally goes against these principles. Therefore, at this time, and
        in its current form, I cannot in good conscience use generative AI within my work.<br>
      <p>GenAI <b>openly plagiarises</b> and regurgitates the work of human creatives en masse, without our consent or offer
        of financial compensation.</p>
      <p>GenAI has the capacity to <b>perpetuate harmful biases</b> against already marginalised groups of people.
      </p>
      <p>GenAI has <b>ever-increasing water requirements</b> - the repurcussions of which are already being felt by those
        of less privileged socio-economic groups.</p>

      <p>GenAI <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117"><b>demands huge amounts of energy</b></a>, directly contributing to global warming - which will affect all of us in increasingly devastating
        ways, regardless of wealth or status.</p>
      <p><b>GenAI is not a designer.</b>
        <br>I believe that good design is rooted in the process of empathising with the needs of the client, and
        drawing upon unique solutions firmly rooted in knowledge and experience of core design principles and research. GenAI does not - and may never - have the capacity to replicate this process.
