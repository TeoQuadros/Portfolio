      <h2>Broad-spectrum designer</h2>

      <p class="large-text">I define myself as such because my skillset is wide and my approach to design deeply
        holistic. I enjoy the variety and flexibility that comes from wielding many tools and understanding a range of
        processes within the art and design ecosystem. I believe that strategic thinking, creative vision and diverse
        technical skills complement and uplift each other. Whether a project demands deep work within one area, or
        offers the possibility to take ownership of an entire design/ideation pipeline, I draw upon all of my skills
        across the spectrum to make that happen.

      <h2>Web design that doesn't make your dev(s) cry :3</h2>
      <p class="large-text">I design for web with a code-informed approach.
        <br>While development work isn't my particular passion, I bring a competent understanding of common frontend
        principles & workflows (Github, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap/Tailwind) to my design projects. I can jump into VS Code to
        tweak styling or iterate straight-to-code if needed.

        <br>This means I understand the impact of my design choices on complexity/time-intensity/energy efficiency of
        implementing them, for a smoother, happier handover.

      <h2>Graphic illustration - a mad scientist approach</h2>
      <p class="large-text">My design process starts by getting really curious about a project’s theme and purpose, learning all I can through deep visual and written research. I usually start with freehand sketches and photographic moodboards - before breaking ideas down, simplifying, and squishing them back together in new and interesting ways that grab people’s attention.</p> 

<p class="large-text">While the majority of my professional experience lies in corporate and informational graphics with clearly defined styles, I’d jump at the opportunity to mix things up a bit. If you’re interested in digital design that incorporates traditional techniques like painting, collage or charcoal work, please get in touch.

      <h2>User experiences that just work</h2>
      <p class="large-text">I love the challenge of building user journeys, especially those with complex restrictions
        on the backend that require creative solutions. While conversions adding up is often critical, I make it my aim
        to focus on creating journeys that reduce friction, prioritise accessibility beyond the bare minimum and build
        trust with the end user. I particularly enjoy the opportunity to handle both the UX and UI of a project -
        pushing me both technically and creatively.

      <h2>AI Statement</h2>

      <button class="accordion">
        <p class="large-text">I do not use any kind of AI within my workflow. Find out why</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="large-text">
          <b>At my core, I strive to respect people and the planet - minimising harm and contributing to positive change
            where possible.</b>
        </p>
        <p>In my opinion, GenAI fundamentally goes against these principles. Therefore, at this time, and
          in its current form, I cannot in good conscience use generative AI within my work.<br>
        <p>GenAI <b>openly plagiarises</b> and regurgitates the work of human creatives en masse, without our consent or
          offer
          of financial compensation.</p>
        <p>GenAI has the capacity to <b>perpetuate harmful biases</b> against already marginalised groups of people.
        </p>
        <p>GenAI has <b>ever-increasing water requirements</b> - the repurcussions of which are already being felt by
          those
          of less privileged socio-economic groups.</p>

        <p>GenAI <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117"><b>demands huge
              amounts of energy</b></a>, directly contributing to global warming - which will affect all of us in
          increasingly devastating
          ways, regardless of wealth or status.</p>
        <p><b>GenAI is not a designer.</b>
          <br>I believe that good design is rooted in the process of empathising with the needs of the client, and
          drawing upon unique solutions firmly rooted in knowledge and experience of core design principles and
          research.
          GenAI does not - and may never - have the capacity to replicate this process.
