      1 working day (10 hours)
    </p>

    <h2>
      Brief
    </h2>
    <p>
      Take a basic wireframe of a site in development, and create a clean, polished and friendly design to overlay the
      existing basic structure.
      There was no creative direction or existing branding, so I had full free rein over the direction - other than a
      request to incorporate a hand-drawn style.

    </p>

    <h2>
      Problems/Constraints
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Time</b> - I had to take this project from basic wireframes - to a cohesive design within a day. Complex custom
      illustrations or highly experimental elements were out of the question, in favour of a solid font, colour palette
      and element styling.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Development time</b> - The time available for initial implementation & client feedback was 1 week in total. I
      was mindful of the complexity/time-intensity of the design in terms of frontend dev work, and tried to think about
      the most straightforward styling changes that would have maximum impact.

    </p>

    <h2>
      Solution
    </h2>
    <p>
      I started by researching the project itself - on its website, CommunityCred defines itself as:
      <br>“a feasibility study exploring the potential for a mutual credit system to accelerate Scotland's transition to
      a circular economy and promote community wealth building. Our platform maps local trading networks, identifies
      opportunities for resource sharing, and supports the development of sustainable local supply chains. <br>

    <p>"By connecting local businesses, social enterprises, charities, and community groups, we aim to strengthen local
      economies while promoting environmental sustainability and social inclusion.

      <br>CommunityCred is a collaborative project between University of Edinburgh researchers, circular economy
      organisations Ostreroand Lower Impact Living, and software engineering company Happy Porch.”
    </p>


    </p>
    <p>
      From this, I identified some key tonal characteristics to help direct my creative choices:
      <p><b>Community-focused:</b> <em>friendly, warm, accessible</em></p>
      <p><b>For businesses, social enterprises, charities, community groups:</b> <em>trustworthy, clean, professional</em></p>
