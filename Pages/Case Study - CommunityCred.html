      Timescale
    </h2>
    <p>
      1 working day (10 hours)
    </p>

    <h2>
      Brief
    </h2>
    <p>
      Take a basic wireframe of a site in development, and create a clean, polished and friendly design to overlay the
      existing basic structure.
      There was no creative direction or existing branding, so I had full free rein over the direction - other than a
      request to incorporate a hand-drawn style.

    </p>

    <h2>
      Problems/Constraints
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Time</b> - I had to take this project from basic wireframes - to a cohesive design within a day. Complex custom
      illustrations or highly experimental elements were out of the question, in favour of a solid font, colour palette
      and element styling.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Development time</b> - The time available for initial implementation & client feedback was 1 week in total. I
      was mindful of the complexity/time-intensity of the design in terms of frontend dev work, and tried to think about
      the most straightforward styling changes that would have maximum impact.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Concept
    </h2>
    <p>Quick implementation, large visual impact.
      <br>To use basic visual styling effectively to create a brand identity that isn’t reliant on custom graphics, or
      complex development work.
      <br>To incorporate the client request for a hand-drawn feel while keeping the overall aesthetic fit for purpose
      and
      target user.
    </p>



    <h2>
      Research
    </h2>
    <p>I started by researching the project itself - on its website, CommunityCred defines itself as:
    <blockquote>“a feasibility study exploring the potential for a mutual credit system to accelerate Scotland's
      transition to a circular economy and promote community wealth building. Our platform maps local trading networks,
      identifies opportunities for resource sharing, and supports the development of sustainable local supply chains.

      <br>By connecting local businesses, social enterprises, charities, and community groups, we aim to strengthen
      local economies while promoting environmental sustainability and social inclusion.

      <br>CommunityCred is a collaborative project between University of Edinburgh researchers, circular economy
      organisations Ostrero and Lower Impact Living, and software engineering company Happy Porch.”
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>From this, I identified some key tonal characteristics to help direct my creative choices:</p>
    <ul class="brief">
      <li>Community-focused: friendly, warm, accessible</li>
      <li>For businesses, social enterprises, charities, community groups: trustworthy, clean, professional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Process
    </h2>
    <p>Mindful of time constraints, I chose to focus on 4 key areas: Font, Colour, Component Style and Accents
    </p>
    <h4>Font</h4>
    <p>Mazaeni - Hero/H1: This bold serif typeface offers a sense of joyful simplicity, grounded in elegance. As
      CommunityCred has no logo at this time, I chose a display font which can hold its own - on the navbar as a
      typography logo and as a bold, striking H1.</p>
    <p>Work Sans - Body/Subheading: Work Sans is a friendly, legible sans serif that looks pleasing at regular and bold
      weights. I chose this custom body font to add character with minimal visual fatigue. Keeping in mind the client
      request for a hand-drawn feel, I used this font as a compromise - as it feels softer and more welcoming then - for
      example - Arial, while maintaining a visually clean and professional feel which may be lost with a handwriting
      font.</p>

    <h4>Colour</h4>

    <p>
      From this, I identified some key tonal characteristics to help direct my creative choices:
    <p><b>Community-focused:</b> <em>friendly, warm, accessible</em></p>
    <p><b>For businesses, social enterprises, charities, community groups:</b> <em>trustworthy, clean,
        professional</em>
    </p>

    <div class="row" id="swatch-row">
      <div class="column" id="swatch"><img class="small-image-text-block"
          src="/Assets\Case Studies\CommunityCred\DarkBlue-Swatch.png" alt="Direction Signpost" width="100%">
      </div>
      <p>#1e0060: Dark blue is very often used in the financial sector to communicate safety, stability and
        professionalism.
        <br>I selected it to communicate these characteristics, but the version used here leans towards
        purple - pulling in a little red to warm up the overall feel, adding a sense of playfulness and innovation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row" id="swatch-row">
      <div class="column" id="swatch"><img class="small-image-text-block" src="/Assets\Case Studies\CommunityCred\Cream-Swatch.png"
          alt="Direction Signpost" width="100%">
      </div>
      <p>#fff6f2: Used as the background colour. Gentler on the eyes then a plain white background.
        (slightly more energy efficient on OLED screens, too!) Intended to elicit a sense of warmth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row" id="swatch-row">
      <div class="column" id="swatch"><img class="small-image-text-block"
          src="/Assets\Case Studies\CommunityCred\LightBlue-Swatch.png" alt="Direction Signpost" width="100%">
      </div>
      <p>#fff6f2: For secondary use. Pops against warm background and harmonises with the deep blue.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Component Style</h4>
    <div class="row" id="swatch-row">
      <div class="column" id="component-style"><img class="large-image"
          src="/Assets\Case Studies\CommunityCred\Component.png" alt="CommunityCred Branding" width="100%"></div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>
          To try and bring in some of the ‘hand drawn’ feel, I opted for visible borders around some elements - mixing
          dashed lines and solid lines for added character, and to help define some visual hierarchy.</em>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Accents</h4>
    <div class="row" id="swatch-row">
      <div class="column" id="component-style"><img class="large-image"
          src="/Assets\Case Studies\CommunityCred\Arrow_Illustration.png" alt="CommunityCred Branding" width="100%">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>
          As there was no time for custom/complex graphics, I created some simple line art in Penpot to add a touch of
          movement and visual interest to the homepage.
          This could provide a basis for a set of similar line graphics in the future.
