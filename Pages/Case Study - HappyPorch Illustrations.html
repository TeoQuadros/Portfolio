      Timescale
    </h2>
    <p>
      Multiple sprints over approx. 3 years, spanning from 2021 to 2024 - potentially ongoing. Lenth of sprints varied
      based on urgency and other ongoing projects, but I usually had around 1 month of iteration and feedback cycles.
      <br>It's important to note that I started out with almost no graphic design expereince. I see this project a bit
      like as a barometer of my progress and confidence within Illustrator over 3 years.

      <ul class="brief">
        <li>Based off of 4 existing brand illustrations, expand the library of available graphics for
          use on the HappyPorch website, various marketing materials and social media posts.</li>
        <li>While maintaining cohesion, incorporate some more organic shapes and imagery.</li>
        <li>Utilise the simple line drawing style, width and colour of the existing graphics.</li>
        <li>Visually reference the intersection of technology (especially circular economy concepts)
          and natural imagery to highlight HappyPorch’s commitment to addressing environmental issues with their
          software solutions.</li>

    <h2>
      Problems/Constraints
    </h2>
    <p>
      Images need to feel consistent with one another, but illustrate different concepts without repeating the same
      imagery over and over again.
      <br>I must stick to the line drawn style as defined by the previous graphic designer, although I have some room to
      stylistically experiment / deviate slightly.
      <br>Colours must be limited to the HappyPorch brand dark green for linework, plus potentially one accent colour.
      <br>They should be able to be used in different contexts and use cases to maximise their usability.
    </p>


    <h2>
      Process
    </h2>

    <h4>Word Bank</h4>
    <p>
      For an illustrative project like this, I start by building a word bank of associations that fit the theme. For
      this project, I wrote down words relating to technology, circular economy, environmental impact and social good. I
      then tie together concepts that work together- focusing on pairing up technological imagery with concepts relating
      to nature.
      Some of the illustrations were designated to illustrate certain topics, so these words were the starting point for
      these eg. the Impact Report Illustrations.

    </p>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>Using some of the identified keywords/phrases/ideas, I search for pictures relating to these concepts online, to
      get a better idea of shapes to incorporate and further generate ideas. I also research artists with similar line
      styles, to better inform my shape language later down the line. I looked at the HappyPorch website to look at the
      kind of language used to communicate these ideas of technology for environmental good, and added some additional
      words/phrases to the word bank.
    </p>

    <h4>Sketching</h4>
    <p>The first drawing I do is always with pen and paper. It allows me to freely sketch all ideas I have without
      over-perfecting or developing them. I draw all my initial concepts and then start to pare them down to the
      required number or the ones which fit the topic the best.
    </p>

    <h4>Illustrator
    </h4>
    <p>I take photos / scan my hand drawn drafts and add them to Illustrator. I mark the concepts I want to spend time
      developing - although sometimes I discard an idea later in the iteration process so I keep all my sketches close
      by, in case I need to refer to them again. I also sometimes end up blending two initial concepts together, which
      is easier once I transition to vector art.
    </p>

    <h4>Iteration / Refinement
    </h4>
    <p>I develop the chosen concepts digitally, usually until I have a 1st draft that I can ask for feedback on.
      After receiving any feedback / changes I continue to refine the illustrations. For sets of illustrations I try to
      ensure visual cohesion between each graphic, focusing on elements such as:


    <ul class="brief">
      <li><b>Visual weight:</b> Do they all carry equivalent weight? Are dark areas or accent colours of a similar size?
        Do they take a similar amount of space, visually?</li>
      <li><b>Detail:</b> Is the level of detail consistent across the illustrations? Do I need to add/remove detail or
        express a shape differently to ensure it fits the style?</li>
      <li><b>Style consistency:</b> Do I use consistent expressions of different shapes? If I use the same motif across
        multiple illustrations, are they consistent in the way they’re constructed?</li>
      <li><b>Micro/macro white space:</b> Do elements sit too closely together, or feel disconnected from one another?
        How does the white space look when I zoom in/out?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Solution
    </h2>
    <h4>First Illustrations - 2021
    </h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="row" id="two-column">
        <div class="column"><img class="large-image" src="/Assets\2021-1.png" alt="Direction Signpost" width="100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column"><img class="large-image" src="/Assets\2021-2.png" alt="Impact Focused" width="100%"></div>

    </div>
<p>I created these two illustrations in Photoshop as I didn’t have access to Illustrator at the time. This presented significant challenges in crating clean and consistent shapes and managing resolution, as they were not created as vectors, but as pixel-based images. I was very inexperienced in creating graphics in this style when starting this project - it was a huge learning curve and a valuable opportunity to learn.</p>

    <p>There are many tweaks I would now make to these in terms of spacing, line consistency and balance. However, there
      were also design elements such as the 10 degree line which, at the time, I was trying to incorporate before we
      made the decision to remove this from the branding. This offered a lot more flexibility in options for graphics
      and removed some implementation difficulties from the development end.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="cardheader">Takeaways
      </h4>

      <ul class="brief">
        <li>Upgrading to Adobe Illustrator was a priority I identified for myself, to allow for a smoother and more
          professional workflow and enabling the switch to vector graphics.</li>
        <li>My interpretation of the style was positively received, and I got the go-ahead to be a bit experimental and
          playful with the imagery for future illustrations.</li>
        <li>I aimed to improve consistency and balance (which would be enabled by switching to a vector-based workflow)
          and further refine my skill in visually communicating ideas.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Illustrations for Website Update
    </h4>
    <p>These three illustrations were created for specific sections within the HappyPorch website.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="row" id="two-column">
        <div class="column"><img class="large-image" src="/Assets\2022-1.png" alt="Direction Signpost" width="100%">
          <div class="desc">Fractional CTO Expertise</div>
        </div>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>


    <p>The concept of organic growth intersecting with technology for good was the guiding principle behind these
      illustrations, and what would go on to form the backbone for future designs. We decided to lean into the simple
      style and build on this sense of whimsy and playfulness.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="cardheader">Takeaways</h4>
      <ul class="brief">
        <li>Looking back, I can see some issues with micro white space. With a few tweaks, these designs could be
          improved by giving elements a bit more room to breathe, which would achieve a cleaner and more visually
          balanced end result.</li>
        <li>The map illustration makes a great background graphic when the opacity is lowered. This opens up some fun
          use cases for some of the simpler illustrations.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Impact Report 2023
    </h4>
    <p>I designed this set of illustrations for HappyPorch’s 2022 annual Impact Report. My aim was to explore the single
      line style further and received the go-ahead to be a bit experimental. </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column"><img class="large-image" src="/Assets\Charity_2022ImpactReport.png" alt="Charity"

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>


    <p>The pop of colour was an additional request, and I selected this warm, bright light green to convey growth and
      positivity - in addition to being complementary to the HappyPorch orange colour. This set is less focused on
      technological imagery, as they are designed to illustrate the section headers. I aimed to create imagery that
      feels playful, capable, organic and human.
      <br>These went on to be used in other places within HappyPorch’s branding/marketing which gave me confidence that
      I was on the right track with the aesthetic of the illustrations.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="cardheader">Takeaways</h4>
      <ul class="brief">
        <li>I gained confidence with Illustrator and explored some more technically challenging ideas that I believe
          were quite visually successful.</li>
        <li>The balance of white space was implemented much more successfully. Increasing the complexity of
          illustrations means this is increasingly important to minimise visual clutter and create a polished,
          professional end result.</li>

    <p>This set of illustrations was created for HappyPorch’s 2023 impact report. I was essentially left to my own
      devices with the brief for these, so I chose ‘busy hands’ as the guiding concept - inspired by this illustration
      from the previous year’s image. My two main visual elements for this set was hands and negative space. I also got
      the go ahead to add some additional skin tones, as these illustrations are transparent and displayed on a white
      background and I wanted to better reflect the diversity within our ‘busy hands’.
      <br>I wanted to push myself a bit with the negative space, and had to iterate a lot to come to the versions here.
      Balancing the light and dark elements and ensuring they didn’t look too busy or complicated took some time, and
      the micro whitespace within the illustrations took a lot of refinement.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="cardheader">Takeaways</h4>
      <ul class="brief">
        <li>This set of graphics have a relatively consistent (heavier) visual weight through the incorporation of the
          dark block shapes. They really feel like a ‘set’, and I think they complement each other well.</li>
        <li>Although they’re not perfect, these demonstrate clear development of my technical skills as I take on
          increasingly demanding design ideas. I strive to continue pushing myself and the working with - not against -
          the limitations of this style in the future.</li>
