      Timescale
    </h2>
    <p>
      Multiple sprints over approx. 3 years, spanning from 2021 to 2024 - potentially ongoing. Lenth of sprints varied
      based on urgency and other ongoing projects, but I usually had around 1 month of iteration and feedback cycles.

    <div>
      <ul class="brief">
        <li>Based off of 4 existing brand illustrations, expand the library of available graphics for
          use on the HappyPorch website, various marketing materials and social media posts.</li>
        <li>While maintaining cohesion, incorporate some more organic shapes and imagery.</li>
        <li>Utilise the simple line drawing style, width and colour of the existing graphics.</li>
        <li>Visually reference the intersection of technology (especially circular economy concepts)
          and natural imagery to highlight HappyPorch’s commitment to addressing environmental issues with their
          software solutions.</li>

    <h2>
      Problems/Constraints
    </h2>
    <p>
      Images need to feel consistent with one another, but illustrate different concepts without repeating the same
      imagery over and over again.
      <br>I must stick to the line drawn style as defined by the previous graphic designer, although I have some room to
      stylistically experiment / deviate slightly.
      <br>Colours must be limited to the HappyPorch brand dark green for linework, plus potentially one accent colour.
      <br>They should be able to be used in different contexts and use cases to maximise their usability.
    </p>


    <h2>
      Process:
    </h2>

    <h4>Word Bank</h4>
    <p>
      For an illustrative project like this, I start by building a word bank of associations that fit the theme. For
      this project, I wrote down words relating to technology, circular economy, environmental impact and social good. I
      then tie together concepts that work together- focusing on pairing up technological imagery with concepts relating
      to nature.
      Some of the illustrations were designated to illustrate certain topics, so these words were the starting point for
      these eg. the Impact Report Illustrations.

    </p>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>Using some of the identified keywords/phrases/ideas, I search for pictures relating to these concepts online, to
      get a better idea of shapes to incorporate and further generate ideas. I also research artists with similar line
      styles, to better inform my shape language later down the line. I looked at the HappyPorch website to look at the
      kind of language used to communicate these ideas of technology for environmental good, and added some additional
      words/phrases to the word bank.
    </p>

    <h4>Sketching</h4>
    <p>The first drawing I do is always with pen and paper. It allows me to freely sketch all ideas I have without
      over-perfecting or developing them. I draw all my initial concepts and then start to pare them down to the
      required number or the ones which fit the topic the best.
    </p>

    <h4>Illustrator
    </h4>
    <p>I take photos / scan my hand drawn drafts and add them to Illustrator. I mark the concepts I want to spend time
      developing - although sometimes I discard an idea later in the iteration process so I keep all my sketches close
      by, in case I need to refer to them again. I also sometimes end up blending two initial concepts together, which
      is easier once I transition to vector art.
    </p>

    <h4>Iteration / Refinement
    </h4>
    <p>I develop the chosen concepts digitally, usually until I have a 1st draft that I can ask for feedback on.
      After receiving any feedback / changes I continue to refine the illustrations. For sets of illustrations I try to
      ensure visual cohesion between each graphic, focusing on elements such as:


    <ul class="brief">
      <li><b>Visual weight:</b> Do they all carry equivalent weight? Are dark areas or accent colours of a similar size? Do they take a similar amount of space, visually?</li>
      <li><b>Detail:</b> Is the level of detail consistent across the illustrations? Do I need to add/remove detail or express a shape differently to ensure it fits the style?</li>
      <li><b>Style consistency:</b> Do I use consistent expressions of different shapes? If I use the same motif across multiple illustrations, are they consistent in the way they’re constructed?</li>
      <li><b>Micro/macro white space:</b> Do elements sit too closely together, or feel disconnected from one another? How does the white space look when I zoom in/out</li>
    </ul>
