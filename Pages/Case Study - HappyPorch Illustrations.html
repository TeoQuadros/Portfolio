      Timescale
    </h2>
    <p>
      Multiple sprints over approx. 3 years, spanning from 2021 to 2024 - potentially ongoing. Lenth of sprints varied
      based on urgency and other ongoing projects, but I usually had around 1 month of iteration and feedback cycles.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Brief

    <div>
      <ul class="brief">
        <li>Based off of 4 existing brand illustrations, expand the library of available graphics for
          use on the HappyPorch website, various marketing materials and social media posts.</li>
        <li>While maintaining cohesion, incorporate some more organic shapes and imagery.</li>
        <li>Utilise the simple line drawing style, width and colour of the existing graphics.</li>
        <li>Visually reference the intersection of technology (especially circular economy concepts)
          and natural imagery to highlight HappyPorch’s commitment to addressing environmental issues with their
          software solutions.</li>

    <h2>
      Problems/Constraints
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Time</b> - I had to take this project from basic wireframes - to a cohesive design within a day. Complex custom
      illustrations or highly experimental elements were out of the question, in favour of a solid font, colour palette
      and element styling.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Development time</b> - The time available for initial implementation & client feedback was 1 week in total. I
      was mindful of the complexity/time-intensity of the design in terms of frontend dev work, and tried to think about
      the most straightforward styling changes that would have maximum impact.

    </p>

    <h2>
      Solution
    </h2>
    <p>
      I started by researching the project itself - on its website, CommunityCred defines itself as:
      <br>“a feasibility study exploring the potential for a mutual credit system to accelerate Scotland's transition to
      a circular economy and promote community wealth building. Our platform maps local trading networks, identifies
      opportunities for resource sharing, and supports the development of sustainable local supply chains. <br>
    </p>

    <p>"By connecting local businesses, social enterprises, charities, and community groups, we aim to strengthen local
      economies while promoting environmental sustainability and social inclusion.

      <br>CommunityCred is a collaborative project between University of Edinburgh researchers, circular economy
      organisations Ostreroand Lower Impact Living, and software engineering company Happy Porch.”
    </p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>
          From this, I identified some key tonal characteristics to help direct my creative choices:
        <p><b>Community-focused:</b> <em>friendly, warm, accessible</em></p>
        <p><b>For businesses, social enterprises, charities, community groups:</b> <em>trustworthy, clean,
            professional</em>
        </p>
