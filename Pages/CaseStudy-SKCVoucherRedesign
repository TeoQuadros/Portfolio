            <p>
                I was asked to re-design the printable Voucher and Evoucher for SK Chase to modernise them.
                The new designs should be aesthetically pleasing - suitable for customers to print at home and give as a
                gift.
                It must contain all the relevant information as in the current version.
                <br>It's important to note that I started out with almost no graphic design expereince. I see this
                project a bit
                like as a barometer of my progress and confidence within Illustrator over 3 years.

            <p>
                One of SKChase’s clients requested a large image format to feature an enticing photograph of the offer
                purchased. I was asked to prioritise this request.
                Resultingly, there was significantly less usable space for the voucher information.
                A full reimagining of the way this info is presented was therefore needed.
            </p>
            <p>Some information is optional and clients have the possibility to hide certain information types depending
                on their specific needs.
                This meant the design had to accommodate variable informational fields and resize accordingly to avoid
                blank white space, or to accommodate the maximum possible number of informational fields.

            <h2>
                Process
            </h2>

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>I was provided with some samples of different vouchers that presented information in various ways.
I researched ticket/voucher designs online. I looked at some competitors’ voucher designs, too.
</p>

            <h4>Concept Development</h4>
            <p>Using some of the identified keywords/phrases/ideas, I search for pictures relating to these concepts
                online,
                to
                get a better idea of shapes to incorporate and further generate ideas. I also research artists with
                similar line
                styles, to better inform my shape language later down the line. I looked at the HappyPorch website to
                look at
                the
                kind of language used to communicate these ideas of technology for environmental good, and added some
                additional
                words/phrases to the word bank.
            </p>

            <h4>Sketching</h4>
            <p>The first drawing I do is always with pen and paper. It allows me to freely sketch all ideas I have
                without
                over-perfecting or developing them. I draw all my initial concepts and then start to pare them down to
                the
                required number or the ones which fit the topic the best.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="spacer">
            <h4>Illustrator
            </h4>
            <p>I take photos / scan my hand drawn drafts and add them to Illustrator. I mark the concepts I want to
                spend time
                developing - although sometimes I discard an idea later in the iteration process so I keep all my
                sketches close
                by, in case I need to refer to them again. I also sometimes end up blending two initial concepts
                together, which
                is easier once I transition to vector art.
            </p>

            <h4>Iteration / Refinement
            </h4>
            <p>I develop the chosen concepts digitally, usually until I have a 1st draft that I can ask for feedback on.
                After receiving any feedback / changes I continue to refine the illustrations. For sets of illustrations
                I try
                to
                ensure visual cohesion between each graphic, focusing on elements such as:


            <ul class="brief">
                <li><b>Visual weight:</b> Do they all carry equivalent weight? Are dark areas or accent colours of a
                    similar
                    size?
                    Do they take a similar amount of space, visually?</li>
                <li><b>Detail:</b> Is the level of detail consistent across the illustrations? Do I need to add/remove
                    detail or
                    express a shape differently to ensure it fits the style?</li>
                <li><b>Style consistency:</b> Do I use consistent expressions of different shapes? If I use the same
                    motif
                    across
                    multiple illustrations, are they consistent in the way they’re constructed?</li>
                <li><b>Micro/macro white space:</b> Do elements sit too closely together, or feel disconnected from one
                    another?
                    How does the white space look when I zoom in/out?</li>

                    <p>I created these two illustrations in Photoshop as I didn’t have access to Illustrator at the
                        time. This
                        presented
                        significant challenges in crating clean and consistent shapes and managing resolution, as they
                        were not
                        created as
                        vectors, but as pixel-based images. I was very inexperienced in creating graphics in this style
                        when
                        starting this
                        project - it was a huge learning curve and a valuable opportunity to learn.</p>

                </div>
            </div>


            <p>There are many tweaks I would now make to these in terms of spacing, line consistency and balance.
                However,
                there
                were also design elements such as the 10 degree line which, at the time, I was trying to incorporate
                before we
                made the decision to remove this from the branding. This offered a lot more flexibility in options for
                graphics
                and removed some implementation difficulties from the development end.</p>

                    <li>My interpretation of the style was positively received, and I got the go-ahead to be a bit

                        playful with the imagery for future illustrations.</li>

                these
                illustrations, and what would go on to form the backbone for future designs. We decided to lean into the
                simple
                style and build on this sense of whimsy and playfulness.</p>

                        could be
                        improved by giving elements a bit more room to breathe, which would achieve a cleaner and more

            <p>The pop of colour was an additional request, and I selected this warm, bright light green to convey
                growth and
                positivity - in addition to being complementary to the HappyPorch orange colour. This set is less
                focused on
                technological imagery, as they are designed to illustrate the section headers. I aimed to create imagery
                that
                feels playful, capable, organic and human.
                <br>These went on to be used in other places within HappyPorch’s branding/marketing which gave me
                confidence
                that
                I was on the right track with the aesthetic of the illustrations.

                    <li>The balance of white space was implemented much more successfully. Increasing the complexity of

            <p>I designed this set of illustrations for HappyPorch’s 2022 annual Impact Report. My aim was to explore
                the
                single
                line style further and received the go-ahead to be a bit experimental. </p>

            <p>This set of illustrations was created for HappyPorch’s 2023 impact report. I was essentially left to my
                own
                devices with the brief for these, so I chose ‘busy hands’ as the guiding concept - inspired by this
                illustration
                from the previous year’s image. My two main visual elements for this set was hands and negative space. I
                also
                got
                the go ahead to add some additional skin tones, as these illustrations are transparent and displayed on
                a white
                background and I wanted to better reflect the diversity within our ‘busy hands’.
                <br>I wanted to push myself a bit with the negative space, and had to iterate a lot to come to the
                versions
                here.
                Balancing the light and dark elements and ensuring they didn’t look too busy or complicated took some
                time, and
                the micro whitespace within the illustrations took a lot of refinement.

                    <li>This set of graphics have a relatively consistent (heavier) visual weight through the
                        incorporation of the
                        dark block shapes. They really feel like a ‘set’, and I think they complement each other well.
                    </li>
                    <li>Although they’re not perfect, these demonstrate clear development of my technical skills as I
                        take on
                        increasingly demanding design ideas. I strive to continue pushing myself and the working with -
                        not against
                        -
                        the limitations of this style in the future.</li>
