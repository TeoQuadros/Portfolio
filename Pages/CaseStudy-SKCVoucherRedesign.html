                    <li>I was asked to re-design the printable Voucher and Evoucher for SK Chase to modernise them. The
                        new designs should be aesthetically pleasing - suitable for customers to print at home and give
                        as a gift.


                    </li>
                    <li>The print version and E-voucher have different requirements and functionality, so they need
                        separate design processes.</li>

                    <li>It must contain all the relevant information as in the current version.</li>
                    <li>The vouchers are printed on A4 paper, and each design needs to be foldable into at least 2, if
                        not three to easily fit into an envelope.</li>
                    <li>A stretch goal, I was asked to design something which offers more possibilities for client
                        customisation.</li>

                    <li>One of SKChase’s clients requested a large image format to feature an enticing photograph of the
                        offer purchased. I was asked to prioritise this request.
                        Resultingly, there was significantly less usable space for the voucher information.
                        A full reimagining of the way this info is presented was therefore needed.

                    </li>
                    <li>Some information is optional to display and clients have the possibility to hide certain fields
                        depending on their specific needs. </li>

                    <li>This meant the design had to accommodate variable informational fields and resize accordingly to
                        avoid blank white space, or to accommodate the maximum possible number of informational fields.

                        <p>SK Chase caters to many different hotels with diverse branding requirements.
                            The information and branding displayed is pulled from various places within the CMS and
                            automatically populates the print/e-voucher templates, so the design concept needs to
                            accommodate variables such as the word count of personal message and voucher details.</p>

                        <p>To cater to a variety of preferences, I opted to create three different templates - one with
                            an
                            image taking up 50% of total space, one with 33% image and a low-ink version with no image.
                        </p>

                        <p>I mapped out overlays of ½ and ⅓ folds while designing the layout of the page to ensure the
                            folds
                            don’t overlap content fields.</p>

                        <p>This can only be done approximately due to the variable lengths of the text fields and their
                            ability to expand, but the folds still lie in the white space between fields.</p>

                        <p>I will develop a bar for the bottom of the page with modular fields containing all info, for
                            maximum space efficiency. This will be used in all 3 formats for visual consistency and ease
                            of
                            use.</p>

                Solution
            </h2>
            <p>The general anatomy of the template can be split into three sections:</p>

            <ul class="brief">
                <li>Decorative image (except for ink-saving version) and hotel logo </li>
                <li>Voucher content & personal message</li>
                <li>Booking information </li>

            <h4>Booking information component</h4>




            <div class="row">
                <div class="column-full"><img class="large-image"
                        src="/Assets\Case Studies\SKC-Vouchers\Bottom_Component-old.png" alt="Direction Signpost"></div>

        <div class="column-full">
            <p>My first priority was developing the field containing the booking information. I blocked out the
                necessary number of fields for the maximum amount of info, grouping fields by similarity. I
                ensured all the needed info was placed next to each other for ease of use.
            </p>
            <p>The old design evenly distributed all of the booking information across the page, which is
                possible as it doesn’t feature an image. My idea was to make a design with a large image
                possible by condensing and organising all the booking information into a much smaller space, and
                utilising that space more efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>I used PenPot flex boards to create the layout. This allowed me to mock up the concept using CSS
                flex. I used this to simulate how information fields re-format when different fields were hidden
                (opted out of by hotel clients), to mimic the behaviour of the final template.
                My aim was to account for all possibilities of hidden/visible fields so that the information bar
                would look aesthetically pleasing without any obvious blank spaces or overflow.

            <p>The concept of organic growth intersecting with technology for good was the guiding principle behind
                these
                illustrations, and what would go on to form the backbone for future designs. We decided to lean into the
                simple
                style and build on this sense of whimsy and playfulness.</p>

                    <li>Looking back, I can see some issues with micro white space. With a few tweaks, these designs
                        could be
                        improved by giving elements a bit more room to breathe, which would achieve a cleaner and more

                        use cases for some of the simpler illustrations.</li>

            <p>The pop of colour was an additional request, and I selected this warm, bright light green to convey
                growth and
                positivity - in addition to being complementary to the HappyPorch orange colour. This set is less
                focused on
                technological imagery, as they are designed to illustrate the section headers. I aimed to create imagery
                that
                feels playful, capable, organic and human.
                <br>These went on to be used in other places within HappyPorch’s branding/marketing which gave me
                confidence
                that
                I was on the right track with the aesthetic of the illustrations.

            <p>This set of illustrations was created for HappyPorch’s 2023 impact report. I was essentially left to my
                own
                devices with the brief for these, so I chose ‘busy hands’ as the guiding concept - inspired by this
                illustration
                from the previous year’s image. My two main visual elements for this set was hands and negative space. I
                also
                got
                the go ahead to add some additional skin tones, as these illustrations are transparent and displayed on
                a white
                background and I wanted to better reflect the diversity within our ‘busy hands’.
                <br>I wanted to push myself a bit with the negative space, and had to iterate a lot to come to the
                versions
                here.
                Balancing the light and dark elements and ensuring they didn’t look too busy or complicated took some
                time, and
                the micro whitespace within the illustrations took a lot of refinement.

                    <li>This set of graphics have a relatively consistent (heavier) visual weight through the
                        incorporation of the
                        dark block shapes. They really feel like a ‘set’, and I think they complement each other well.

                    <li>Although they’re not perfect, these demonstrate clear development of my technical skills as I
                        take on
                        increasingly demanding design ideas. I strive to continue pushing myself and the working with -
                        not against
                        -
                        the limitations of this style in the future.</li>
