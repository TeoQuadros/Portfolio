                On its website, CommunityCred defines itself as:
                “a feasibility study exploring the potential for a mutual credit system to accelerate Scotland's
                transition to a circular economy and promote community wealth building. Our platform maps local trading
                networks, identifies opportunities for resource sharing, and supports the development of sustainable
                local supply chains.”
            </p>
            <p class="large-text">
                My role within the project was to take a basic wireframe of a site in development and create a clean,
                polished and friendly design to overlay the existing basic structure. There was no creative direction or
                existing branding, so I had full free rein over the direction - other than a request to incorporate a
                hand-drawn style.
            </p>
            <p class="large-text">
                I had to take this project from basic wireframes - to a cohesive design within a day. Complex custom
                illustrations or highly experimental elements were out of the question, in favour of a solid font,
                colour palette and element styling.
                I was also mindful of the complexity/time-intensity of the design in terms of frontend dev work, and
                tried to think about the most straightforward styling changes that would have maximum impact, as there
                was only 1 week to for the developer to implement the design.
            </p>
            <p class="large-text">
                Mindful of time constraints, I chose to focus on 4 key areas: Font, Colour, Component Style and Accents.

                    <p class="large-text">I was provided with a basic wireframe of the home page which gave me an idea
                        of

            <p>My approach to this project was quick implementation, large visual impact. I aimed to use basic visual
                styling effectively to create an identity that isn’t reliant on custom graphics, or complex development
                work, incorporating the client request for a hand-drawn feel while keeping the overall aesthetic fit for
                purpose and target user.</p>

            <p>I started by looking at CommunityCred’s mission statement:</p>

                strengthen local economies while promoting environmental sustainability and social inclusion.”</p>

        <div class="fourbyone-outline">
            <p>#1e0060: Dark blue is very often used in the financial sector to communicate safety, stability and
                professionalism. This one leans towards purple - pulling in a little red to warm up the overall feel,
                adding a sense of playfulness and innovation.</p>

            <p>Hero/H1: This bold serif typeface offers a sense of joyful simplicity, grounded in elegance. As
                CommunityCred has no logo at this time, I chose a display font which can hold its own - on the navbar as
                a typography logo and as a bold, striking H1.</p>

            <p>Body/Subheading: Work Sans is a friendly, legible sans serif that looks pleasing at regular and bold
                weights. I chose this custom body font to add character with minimal visual fatigue. Keeping in mind the
                client request for a hand-drawn feel, I used this font as a compromise - as it feels soft and welcoming
                while maintaining a visually clean and professional feel which may be lost with a handwriting font.</p>

        <div class="threebyone-outline">
            <p>To try and bring in some of the ‘hand drawn’ feel, I opted for visible borders around some elements -
                mixing dashed lines and solid lines for added character, and to help define some visual hierarchy.</p>
            <p>As there was no time for custom/complex graphics, I created some simple line art in Penpot to add a touch
                of movement and visual interest to the homepage. This could provide a basis for a set of similar line
                graphics in the future.</p>
