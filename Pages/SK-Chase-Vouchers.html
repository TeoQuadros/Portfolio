                SK Chase is voucher, gift and ticketing service partnering with luxury hotels from all around the world.
                This project aimed to modernise both the printable voucher and e-voucher that buyers can choose to
                receive after purchasing a gift.
            </p>
            <p class="large-text">
                I was asked to prioritise a client request to include a large image format to feature an enticing
                photograph of the offer purchased. This meant I had much less usable space for the voucher information
                (which was distributed all across the page in the old voucher layout). It gave me a great excuse to
                fully reimagine the design and get creative in finding ways for the new format to enrich the voucher
                redemption process for buyers.
            </p>




            <p class="large-text">To cater to a variety of preferences, we opted to create three different templates -
                one with an image taking up 50% of total space, one with 33% image and a low-ink version with no image.
                There was also a stretch goal of additional customisation, for which I developed a set of SVG patterns
                to be used as an optional background.
            </p>
            <p class="large-text">I was supported throughout this project by Jan, the Product Manager at SK Chase who
                helped to define the scope and requirements of the redesign, offering her depth of understanding of the
                system and user journeys, in addition to facilitating feedback. I also worked alongside Tom from
                HappyPorch, who was implementing the design. His knowledge of the CMS and technical insight was
                invaluable in ensuring the feasibility of implementing my designs.
            </p>
            <p class="large-text">
                For this project, my process looked like: <br>
                research > concept development > feedback > refinement > stress testing > solution
            </p>
            <p class="large-text"><b><em>"Thank you for your amazing vision and imagination (along with understanding

            <p>SK Chase provided me with some samples of potential concepts that seemed to fit their
                needs. I also spent some time looking at various user journeys for e-voucher redemptions online,
                focusing on information presentation and user interaction. While this provided a good jumping off point
                to start thinking about the core issue of balancing aesthetics and clarity of information, it also
                highlighted the fact that a bespoke solution would be needed to really tackle these core issues and
                elevate the user experience.</p>

            <p>The general anatomy of the template needed to accommodate 3 things:</p>

        <div class="threeby2-outline">
            <p>I mapped out overlays of ½ and ⅓ folds while designing the layout of the page to ensure the folds don’t
                overlap content fields. These dimensions, when folded, fit standard-sized envelopes.</p>
            <p>This can only be done approximately due to the variable lengths of the text fields and their ability to
                expand, but the folds still lie in the white space between fields for the majority of use cases,
                allowing the vouchers to be folded and still look attractive when opened back up.</p>

                < The old design evenly distributes all of the booking information across the page, which is possible as
                    it doesn’t feature an image. My idea was to make a design with a large image possible by condensing
                    and organising all the booking information into a much smaller space, and utilising that space more
                    efficiently.</p>

            <p>I used PenPot flex boards to create the layout. This allowed me to mock up the concept using CSS flex. I
                used this to simulate how information fields re-format when different fields were hidden (opted out of
                by hotel clients), to mimic the behaviour of the final template.
                My aim was to account for all possibilities of hidden/visible fields so that the information bar would
                look aesthetically pleasing without any obvious blank spaces or overflow.</p>

            <p>The main decision for this section was how to display the hotel logo.  I opted to have the logo field
                extending above the voucher content into the image field to maximise the available space for text. For
                clarity and visibility, I placed the logo on a white background. I developed the arc shape to mitigate
                dead white space, instead having the shape curve down like a ‘tab’. </p>
            <p>I tested the proportions of the arc
                with various logos, as they can range from wide and short, to tall and narrow, and everything in
                between. I settled on the arc which offered a middle ground, presenting logos of any size with a little
                breathing room.

            <p>In general, the e-voucher uses the same elements I developed for the printable version, with a few
                modifications.

                With the addition of the ‘print’ buttons, the content is almost the same as in the printable voucher.

                It was requested that I remove the small ‘filler’ images and rework the text area for the voucher
